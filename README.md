i have not been putting anything in my read me file, but maybe ill start now. Another thing, i know punctuation will be a thing here. I will try as much as i can to update this everyday doing my project. 
First, this is my first webpack tutorial. i have been too comfortable with html css, i did not know real things exist. here i am now, about to start crashing out. 
I am already basing everything on my own understanding because the tutorial is not as detailed but i really hope this goes well.I am also using a youtube tutorial from "Dors Coding School". FINGERS CROSSED!
lets start!

I created the repository first, which i dont know if is right because apparently theres something called a git ignore. We'll figure it out with time though.

today, webpack continues to test my patience. i have create more js files ie. contact.js, menu.js and from what the tutorial said tabs.js. i am going to add pictures and paragrapghs to the menu.js and add a form in the contact form. 
I also have a button for home page thats supposed to take you back to homepage. All this is not working now, im still trying to figure out imports and export!!!

dint think id do this in a day, js got hard and i took the html route for the menu and contact js files. i also had to make changes to my tabs.js to ensure  that the headline is cleared.
